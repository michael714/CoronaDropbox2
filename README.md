CoronaDropbox2
==============

Please go to my other repository for continued updates of this code:
https://github.com/michael714/Corona-Dropbox3

This command allows logging from device while attached via USB cable.  At least, it works with a PC and an Android phone.  Hopefully this helps.  I will try to post updates here as they become available. 

I spent weeks getting this code to work.  If you found this to be helpful, please make a donation:
